                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform,object-oriented scripting language.JavaScript is extremeley popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Variable Delcaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variables holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifies.<span1>var x;</span1></li>
                    <li><span>Variable Assignments</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span1>var x = 10;</span1></li>
                    <li><span>Data Types</span> Data tpes are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - <span1>42</span1> or <span1>3.14159;</span1> String - <span1>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span1> Array- <span1>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span1> and Object - <span1>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span1></li>
                    <li><span>Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span1>if</span1> a specified condition is true, do this code in your code block; <span1>else if</span1> to specificy a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span1>else</span1> we execute this block of code;</li>
                    <li><span>Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                    <li><span>Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of its as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up.Done! We finished our instrucctions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
